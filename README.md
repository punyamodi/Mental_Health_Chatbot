## Comprehensive Resources

One of the most valuable features of our chatbot is its extensive database. It contains vital information about psychiatric hospitals and doctors, allowing users to locate the help they need quickly. Whether you're seeking immediate assistance or looking for professional care, our chatbot has you covered.

## Suicide Helpline Numbers

Mental health crises can be overwhelming, and we understand that. This chatbot is not just about information; it's about providing immediate help when it's needed most. It includes a repository of suicide helpline numbers, ensuring that anyone in distress can connect with a caring voice at any time.
